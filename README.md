These python scripts was inteded to use as a Workshop for Women in Tech Summit 2020, to learn about Explainable Artificial Intelligence.

The Workshop is the Notebook named "workshop.ipynd", which is the only one which needs to be opened. The other scripts only contain functions that are imported into the Notebook, but they need to be placed in the same folder as the Notebook. 

The LRP implementation is based on the following papers:

And the functions are based on implementations from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for LSTMs:
